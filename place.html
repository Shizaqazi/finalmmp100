<h1>Story of liza</h1>
<p>So there was this girl named Liza who lived in a busy city. She was a bit of a free spirit and loved to explore, even if it wasn't the usual thing to do. One night, when it was super late, Liza ended up on some empty street all by herself.

Liza was always intrigued by the mystery of the night. The moon put a soft light on everything, making it all look dreamy and hazy. She sat there on the empty street, feeling calm and connected to something beyond what's normal. It was like the street was waiting for her to explore it like a canvas.

Liza had a playful look in her eyes and decided to enjoy the moment by dancing. She got up and moved gracefully across the pavement, swaying and gliding as if she were talking to the night.</p>
